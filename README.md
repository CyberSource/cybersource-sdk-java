}
```
## Requirements
- Java SDK 1.6 and later  
- Maven 3 and later  
- It is recommended to use Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files from Oracle® (US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar) for appropriate JAVA version. For JAVA 7, it is available at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html

## Prerequisites
### CyberSource Evaluation account
Sign up here:  <http://www.cybersource.com/register/>
- Complete your Evaluation account creation by following the instructions in the Registration email

### Transaction Security Keys
Create security keys in the [Enterprise Business Center](https://ebctest.cybersource.com/) after you've created your Merchant Admin account. 
- Refer to our [Developer Guide](http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/security_keys/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=securityKeys_SO_API.4.1.html) for details.

### JCE Unlimited Strength Jars
Replace your Java installation’s existing security policy files with the new ones you downloaded from the Oracle site:
- Locate your existing US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar files in the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security directory.
- Rename or move your existing files to another directory.
- Copy the new US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar that you downloaded from Oracle to the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security directory.  
## Installing the SDK 
You do not need to download and build the source to use the SDK but if you want to do that, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository.
- Go to the `cybersource-sdk-java-master` directory.
- To run the integration tests, edit the [test_cybs.properties](java/src/test/resources/test_cybs.properties) and make the following changes:
  - Set `merchantID`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` to your merchantID.  Please note that it is case-sensitive.
  - Set `keysDirectory` to the directory where your key resides.  Use forward-slashes for the directory separator, even on Windows. For example, "c:/keys"
  - Uncomment & set KeyFilename if you want to use JKS file or if the p12 file name is different from Merchant_ID
  - Optional Additional Changes
    - Set `targetAPIVersion` to the latest version displayed at: https://<cybersource-host>/commerce/1.x/transactionProcessor/. By default, it is set to the latest version when the package was created.
    - Modify the logging properties as appropriate. Use forward-slashes for the directory separator in the `logDirectory` value, even on Windows. The directory you specify must already exist.
    - Set `useSignAndEncrypted` to true, to encrypt the signed Payload.
      - For more information about MLE, See [Message Level Encryption](README.md#message-level-encryption).
    - Set `sendToProduction` config parameter with toggle value "true/false" to send requests to Cybersource production/testing environment.
      - `sendToProduction` is initially set to false. Set it to true only when you are ready to send live transactions.
    - Set `sendToAkamai` config parameter with toggle value "true/false" to turn on/off routing requests through Akamai to Cybersource. By default, it is set to true.
    - `serverURL` config parameter will take precedence over `sendToProduction` and `sendToAkamai` config parameters. By default the `serverURL` configuration is commented out.
    - if `enablejdkcert` parameter is set to true, certificates will be read from the JKS file specified at keysDirectory location. The JKS file should be of the same name as specified in keyFilename.
      - To know how to convert p12 to JKS refer the JKS creation section of this document.
    - `enableCacerts` property is considered only if `enablejdkcert` is set to true. If `enableCacerts` is set to true, certificates will be read from the cacerts folder under the JDK.
    - `allowRetry` config parameter will only work for HttpClient. Set `allowRetry` config parameter to "true" to enable retry mechanism and set merchant specific values for the retry.
    - Set integer values for config parameter `numberOfRetries` *and* `retryInterval`. Retry Interval is time delay for next retry in seconds.
      - Number of retry parameter should be set between 1 to 5. Any other value will throw an Error Message.
      - Refer to the [Retry Pattern](README.md#retry-pattern) section below.
    - Please refer to the accompanying documentation for the other optional properties that you may wish to specify.

- Build this project using Maven.
  - `mvn clean` - Cleans the Project
  - `mvn install` - Builds the project and creates a jar file of client SDK. Includes running all unit tests and integration tests
  - `mvn test` - Runs unit tests
  - `mvn failsafe:integration-test` - Runs unit and integration tests. Note that integration tests require proper setup of `test_cybs.properties`

## Testing the SDK 
We have two ways to test -- one is by downloading the zip and using scripts to test; other is using maven tool.
### Using Scripts
- Unzip the downloaded zip file into a directory of your choice.  It will create a directory called `cybersource-sdk-java-master`. 
  - If in the Request, a key called "_has_escapes" is present and is set to "1", we will not escape the special characters. This is a way for the merchant to specify that they have escaped the characters themselves. This might prove useful for more advanced users of the Basic client.
    - Note: The Script will take Service_name as program argument. Service Name can be auth, auth_reversal, capture, sale, emv_auth, credit. If no argument is passed the script will terminate the program.
- Choosing which sample to test:
  - If you want to test Name-Value Pair, go to the `cybersource-sdk-java-master/samples/nvp` directory.
  - If you want to test XML, go to the `cybersource-sdk-java-master/samples/xml` directory.
- Use `compileSample` scripts to create classes directory as it is not included in SDK.
- Then at a command prompt, type this line:
```
Windows:	runSample.bat <service_name>
Unix or Linux:	runSample.sh <service_name>
```
  - If JAVA_HOME is defined, the script uses <JAVA_HOME>/bin/java. Otherwise, it uses whatever java is in the path.
  - If the client is installed correctly, the requests and replies for a credit card authorization and a follow-on capture appear.
- If you make any changes to the `RunSample.java` sample, you must rebuild the sample before using it. Use the `compileSample` batch file or shell script provided in the sample directory.

### Using samples and maven tool
- Clone/Download the code from GitHub.
- Choosing which sample to test:
  - If you want to test Name-Value Pair, `cd` to the `cybersource-sdk-java-master/samples/nvp` directory.
  - If you want to test XML, `cd` to the `cybersource-sdk-java-master/samples/xml` directory.
    - Sample projects `nvp` and `xml` use `cybersource-sdk-java` and [3rd party jars](README.md#third-party-jars) as dependent jar files.
- Build this project using Maven. `mvn install`
- If build is successful then it will put all jars inside `cybersource-sdk-java/samples/nvp/target/dependencies` folder.
- Edit `cybs.properties` and make the required changes.
- Now use scripts to test.

## JKS creation

- To convert the p12 file to JKS follow the steps mentioned below.
  - These commands will take out all the certs from the p12 file. 
```
openssl pkcs12 -in <Merchant_ID>.p12 -nocerts -out <Merchant_ID>.key
openssl pkcs12 -in <Merchant_ID>.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out  <Merchant_ID>.crt
openssl pkcs12 -in <Merchant_ID>.p12 -cacerts -nokeys -out CyberSourceCertAuth.crt
openssl pkcs12 -in <Merchant_ID>.p12 -cacerts -nokeys -out CyberSource_SJC_US.crt
```
- Create a new p12. Here `Identity.p12` is the new p12 file
```
openssl pkcs12 -export -certfile CyberSourceCertAuth.crt -in <Merchant_ID>.crt -inkey <Merchant_ID>.key -out identity.p12 -name "<Merchant_ID>"
```
- Create JKS from p12 using keytool
```
keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore <Your_keystore_name> -deststorepass <your_password> -srckeystore identity.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass <Merchant_ID>
```
- Now import the CyberSource_SJC_US.crt to your keystore
```
keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file CyberSource_SJC_US.crt -alias CyberSource_SJC_US -keystore <Your_keystore_name>.jks
```
- List the entries of your keystore
```
keytool -list -v -keystore <Your_keystore_name>
```
- It should have two entries.
  - The first entry should contain a chain of two certificates - `CyberSourceCertAuth` and <Merchant_ID> with alias name <Merchant_ID>
  - Second entry should be for `CyberSource_SJC_US` certificate with alias name as `CyberSource_SJC_US`

## Message Level Encryption
CyberSource supports Message Level Encryption (MLE) for Simple Order API. Message level encryption conforms to the SOAP Security 1.0 specification published by the OASIS standards group. 

### Authentication Details
    Message level encryption authenticates using the same mechanism as signed SOAP messages. The signature creation involves utilizing the merchants private key which combined with a hash of the message to be signed, can be validated with the merchants certificate and the message which was signed. 
    The merchant certificate is included in the SOAP message for both signature and message level encryption. Message level encryption, encrypts a temporary message key for a specific recipient. This is done by encrypting the temporary message key with the recipient’s public certificate. Therefore only the party holding the private key (CyberSource) can decrypt the temporary message key. The merchant sending the request must be a valid merchant for the environment which the message is being processed in. After validating the merchant and retrieving the CyberSource copy of the merchant certificate from our database, these additional authentication steps are performed:
    1.	The certificate sent in the message must have valid trust chain with the CyberSource certificate authority as the root signer.
    2.	A certificate belonging to the merchant which sent the message must exist within our database, having the exact serial number of the certificate provided. 
    3.	Our record of the certificate must have a valid start and end date for the transaction time sent.
    4.	Our record of the certificate must have a “active” state (ie. Not deactivated by support).
    5.	If merchant is reseller, the merchant must allow reseller to act upon their behalf and reseller must be configured as a reseller and the provided merchant must be configured as a merchant of this reseller. Additionally all above authorizations apply.

### Cryptography Algorithms
    CyberSource utilizes the following algorithms for this implementation. While others may work, the following are validated and recommended. SSL is used for transport security even with encrypted messages. CyberSource asymmetric keys are RSA 2048 keys and therefore your cryptography API should support 2048 bit RSA keys and signatures create with them. The messages are encrypted with a temporary derived key which is used per message. This derived key is AES 256 bit and utilizes CBC blocking mode for encryption. The derived key is encrypted with the recipient (CyberSource) public key. The key exchange algorithm used is RSA-OAEP.

## Retry Pattern

Retry Pattern allows to retry sending a failed request and it will only work with `useHttpClient=true`. `allowRetry` flag enables the retry mechanism. 
- Set the value of `allowRetry` parameter to "TRUE/FALSE". Then the system will retry the failed request as many times as configured by the merchant in the config parameter 'numberOfRetries'.
  - numberOfRetries parameter value should be set between 0 to 5. By default the value for numberOfRetries will be 5. User can set a delay in between the retry attempts.
  - Config parameter for this property is 'retryInterval' in `cybs.property` file. The default value for 'retryInterval' parameter is 5 which means a delay of 5 seconds.
